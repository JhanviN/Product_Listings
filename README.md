# Frontend Intern Test â€“ Product Listing Page

This is the solution for the **SoftDef Frontend Intern Test**.  
The goal was to create a **pixel-perfect Product Listing Page** based on the Figma design:  
[Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/design/kNs2WbNk5h7qfsQMFOwbXt/Frontend_Role?node-id=0-1&p=t)  

The app is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, using reusable components, client-side mock data, and fully working filters, sorting, pagination, and responsive layouts.

---

## Features Implemented

- Reusable components:
  - `Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `FilterPanel`, `ProductCard`, `Badge`, `Rating`, `Pagination`, `Footer`
- Sidebar filters with expand/collapse functionality
- Product listing grid with:
  - Product image, HOT badge, title, prices, discount, rating, and quick actions
- Color selection filter that visually updates product cards
- Sorting options (Name, Price, Popularity) and pagination
- Fully responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus styles, alt text, ARIA attributes
- Client-side mock data (24+ products)

> **Note:** The cart image may not display in deployed environments due to static asset path handling, but the app is fully functional.
